    While this page tries to be relatively accessible and provides several examples, it's
    also a detailed technical specification for how to create articulation maps (banks)
    for Reaticulate, which might be daunting for new users. Seventh Sam has <a
    href="https://seventhsam.com/blog/blog/6779963/how-to-create-custom-reaticulate-banks-for-your-sample-libraries-120a9322-0e24-4db4-b5db-153a7eaf6334">provided
    an excellent blog post</a>, which may serve as a friendlier introduction to this
    topic.  Erik Wikstrom has also done a <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMdde8jRUZA">video tutorial for The REAPER
    Blog</a> that will help you get started.
    <br/><br/>
    Your best bet would be to start there, and then reference this page for the complete
    details.

## Reaticulate notations for Reabank files

<p class='warning'>
    Unfortunately there isn't yet a GUI for creating custom banks.  This will come in the
    next major release of Reaticulate, but for now, you'll need to understand the nitty
    gritty on this page and use a text editor to create banks.
    <br/><br/>
    You can also <a href="https://github.com/jtackaberry/reaticulate/tree/master/userbanks">
    download user-contributed banks</a> for various libraries.
</p>

Reaticulate directly manages REAPER's assigned global Reabank file, which it dynamically
assembles from both the distributed factory banks and your own custom banks.  Relative to
REAPER's resource directory (which you can find by invoking the REAPER action "Show REAPER
Resource path"), these files are:

1. Factory banks: `Scripts/Reaticulate/Reaticulate-factory.reabank`
   * A selection of banks are bundled with Reaticulate for you to use, but you can't edit these
2. User banks: `Data/Reaticulate.reabank`
   * This file is where you store all your personal or imported banks

(Reaticulate combines these files into a file it manages called `Data/Reaticulate-tmp*.reabank`.
You'll never edit this file directly, but it's what Reaticulate feeds back to REAPER to use as
the default reabank file.)


![floating](../img/reabank-edit.png)

You can take a look at the factory banks for inspiration, but if you want to start slinging
your own custom articulation banks, the easiest way is to click the pencil button at the
top of the UI and open the file in your editor.  Clicking this will create the file if
necessary before opening the editor.  Open in Default App will launch whatever application
you've associated with `.reabank` files.

<p class='warning'>
    Once you save changes to the file, click the reload button (next to the pencil) to force
    Reaticulate to pick up the changes.
</p>

## Anatomy of a standard Reabank file

Let's start by taking a look at the normal REAPER reabank file, which is defined by REAPER
and works out-of-the-box even without Reaticulate.  The standard format is:

```
Bank <MSB> <LSB> <Bank name>
<program #> <articulation name>
```

For example:

```go
Bank 65 1 Spitfire Symphonic Brass - Horn Solo
20 legato
1 long
52 marcato
50 tenuto
40 staccato
100 rip
101 fall
70 trill m2
71 trill M2
```

The two numbers on the Bank line (65 and 1 in the above example) indicate the MSB and LSB
of the MIDI bank.  This stands for Most Significant Byte and Least Significant Byte
respectively, and are defined as part of the MIDI specification.  These values are between
0 and 127 and are somewhat arbitrary, as long as the pair is unique to the REAPER
instance.

ðŸ‘‰ REAPER itself needs the MSB and LSB values, but you don't need to worry about that.
Reaticulate (as of version 0.5.0) automatically takes care of assigning these values. As
you'll see below, all you need to put for these numbers is an asterisk (`*`).

Following the MSB/LSB is an arbitrary name for the bank.

Each subsequent line (until the next Bank line) specifies the programs for the
bank.  The number is the MIDI Program Change event number (which, apart from
the requirement that articuluations in the same bank have unique program
numbers, is technically arbitrary but see the [Program
Numbers](#program-numbers) section below for some advice), and the description
is, in our case for Reaticulate, the name of the articulation.


## Reaticulate notations

Reaticulate extends Reabank files by adding special notations on lines starting with `//!`

Let's revisit the above example bank, now fully notated for Reaticulate, and how this bank
looks in the GUI:

![floating](../img/bank-horn-solo.png)
```go
//! g="Spitfire/Symphonic Brass" n="Horn Solo"
//! m="Set patch to UACC"
//! id=cbbdac4f-34a1-4a1d-86ea-3e9e00365d1f
Bank * * SSB - Horn Solo
//! c=legato i=legato o=cc:32,20
20 legato
//! c=long i=note-whole o=cc:32,1
1 long
//! c=short i=marcato-quarter o=cc:32,52
52 marcato
//! c=short i=tenuto-eighth o=cc:32,50
50 tenuto
//! c=short i=staccato o=cc:32,40
40 staccato
//! c=short-dark i=rip o=cc:32,100
100 rip
//! c=short-dark i=rip-downward o=cc:32,101
101 fall
//! c=long i=trill-min2 o=cc:32,70
70 trill m2
//! c=long i=trill-maj2 o=cc:32,71
71 trill M2
```

Notated attributes take the form `name=value` (or `name="value"` if the value contains spaces)
and are separated by whitespace.  The line(s) prefixed with `//!` immediately preceding the
uncommented line will annotate it with the supplied attributes.

Notice also that in the Reaticulate version of the bank, the MSB/LSB numbers in the "Bank"
line have been replaced with asterisks (`*`).  This is because Reaticulate automatically
picks appropriate values when you first load the bank on some track in a project.

When an articulation is triggered, Reaticulate will emit the MIDI output events defined by
the ``o`` attribute (see below).  In the above example, each articulation sends a single MIDI
event: CC 32 with a value defined by the second argument.  The expectation for this factory bank
is that the Spitfire Horns Solo patch be set to UACC (a feature of the patch itself).


## Attributes for Bank lines

These are the supported attributes for Bank lines.  Attributes are optional unless specifically
marked as required.

<table>
<tr><th style='text-align: center'>Name</th><th style='text-align: left'>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
    <td valign="top" style='text-align: center'>id<br/><code>generated</code></td>
    <td>
        A globally unique id (GUID, though technically speaking it's a UUID4) for this bank.
        <br/><br/>
        Don't define this yourself -- let Reaticulate generate this for you -- but if you share your
        bank with other users, be sure to include the id attribute that Reaticulate generates so
        that projects using this bank can be properly loaded between users.
        <br/><br/>
        When you create a new bank in <code>Reaticulate.reabank</code> and click the Reload toolbar
        button in the GUI, Reaticulate notices that the bank is missing the <code>id</code>
        attribute and new random one is automatically generated. The bank file is then rewritten to
        include this new value.
        <br/><br/>
        Just be aware that if you're editing <code>Reaticulate.reabank</code> in a text editor at the
        same time as Reaticulate generates the GUID and overwrites the file, you'll need to reload it
        in the editor otherwise you risk reverting the GUID.  Best to use an editor that detects
        on-disk changes and reloads for you, such as Visual Studio Code or Notepad++.

        For articulations with note-hold outputs, this defines the "default program" when no note-hold
        articulation is active.  The GUI will show this program as active when a manually triggered
        note-hold keyswitch is released.  When this articulation is explicitly activated via Reaticulate,
        it will cause any active note-hold articulation to be released.

        Default articulation flags. Most can be overridden per articulation. Is a comma-delimited list of one
        or more of the options below.  Any option can be prefixed with <code>!</code> to negate it.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>chase</code>: Chase CCs when target MIDI channel changes. (Default)
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>antihang</code>: Prevent note hanging when a note is released on a different
                channel than it's pressed. (Default)
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>antihangcc</code>: Similar to antihang, but prevents the note from hanging due to sustain
                pedal or breath control (CC 2 and 64).  In other words, it ensures sustain release or breath off is
                sent to the channel where the ringing note was struck, regardless of the current routing. (Default)
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>nobank</code>: Blocks the bank select messages generated by Reaticulate from hitting the
                downstream FX. (Default. Bank level only.)
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>toggle</code>: Triggering the articulation when it's active will deactivate it. It will still
                emit the output events but the UI will indicate the articulation as off if it was previously on.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>hidden</code>: Articulation will not be visible in the UI.  When defined at the bank level
                instead of a specific articulation, the bank will not be available to add to tracks, however
                any existing references to the bank (e.g. in existing projects) will continue to work.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td valign="top" style='text-align: center'>chase</td>
    <td>
        Comma-delimited list of CCs (or CC ranges) that should be "chased" when CC chasing is enabled
        for an articulation (as is default).  For example: 1,2,5,11-21,92-120.  (Default: 1,2,11,64-69)
        <br/><br/>CC chasing occurs when switching articulations between patches across different MIDI channels.  For example, suppose you have long normale on channel 1 and long con sordino on channel 2 with long normale currently active. Say you've set CC1 to value 92 and played a note, and then activated the long con sordino articulation.  If CC1 is included here in the list of CCs to be chased, when long con sordino is activated, CC1 value 92 will be "chased" into the patch on channel 2, ensuring that your
        next note with that articulation has the same dynamics level.<br/><br/>Another use case is with the sustain pedal.  Supposing you're on long normale and you hold the sustain pedal, press a note, and then activate long con sordino and press another note, if CC64 (sustain) is in the chase list, Reaticulate will chase the CC64 "pedal down" value into the next channel so that the second note with that articulation also sustains. Provided the <code>antihangcc</code> flag (mentioned above) is not disabled, when the sustain pedal is released, Reaticulate will send the CC64 value 0 (sustain pedal up) event into <i>both</i> channel 1 (long normale with the first note rining) and channel 2 (long con sordino with the second note ringing), which prevents the first note on the previous (but not currently active) MIDI channel from "hanging."

        For consistency, it is recommended that you use group 1 for the main set of articulations.<br/><br/>
        Note that currently there is a limitation with groups: Groups are a Reaticulate construct that
        Reaper itself doesn't know about.  Upon playback, Reaper will <i>only</i> chase the last program change on
        the channel.  The desired behavior would be for Reaper to chase all articulations on all groups per
        channel, but this isn't possible without some <a href="https://github.com/jtackaberry/reaticulate/issues/55">not-yet-implemented heroics</url>.

## Program Numbers

Within a given bank, each articulation must have its own unique program number.
The specific program number is, strictly speaking, arbitary, however some form
of standardization is recommended because this allows using the
`Reaticulate_Activate articulation by CC` actions to trigger a given
articulation (or at least its closest approximation) from a control surface,
tablet, etc., no matter the underlying instrument.

The primary use case for program number standardization is having a set of common
articulations configured on your MIDI controller for sketching purposes, which, thanks to
common program numbers, can work regardless of the virtual instrument.  An idea can be
expressed with basic articulations, and then you can go back over the MIDI item and
finesse the articulations using Reaticulate's GUI.

Another reason for program number consistency is that articulations can be inserted on
multiple selected tracks at the same time.  Suppose you have 1st Violins from one library
vendor and 2nd Violins from another, and want them both to play staccato at same spot. If
both banks use the same program number for staccato, you can select both tracks and insert
staccato in one shot.

To that end, in consideration of the sketching use case, we recommend using the following
program numbers for these articulations, or the **closest approximation** of these
articulations available in the patch:

| Program # | Articulation |
|-|-|
| 20 | legato normale |
| 1 | long normale / sustain (chords) |
| 7 | long muted (e.g. con sordino) |
| 17 | long soft (e.g. sul tasto or flautando) |
| 9 | long hard (e.g. marcato) |
| 10 | long harmonics |
| 11 | tremolo or flutter |
| 40 | short normale (e.g. staccato) |
| 42 | shorter normale (e.g. spiccato) |
| 52 | short hard (e.g. marcato short or staccato dig) |
| 56 | pizzicato / plucked |
| 70 | trill minor 2 |
| 71 | trill major 2 |


For articulations not included above or if there are multiple candidates, pick any program number not in the above table.  If at all possible, try to find a match against **[Spitfire's UACC specification](https://spitfire-webassets.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/UACCv2spec.pdf)** (which is where the numbering scheme above is derived).

It's not crucial to find an exact match, but it's encouraged.  Use your better judgment.


## Output Events Specification

<p class='warning'>
    This section is a bit nerdy.  It's quite necessary to understand to build your
    own banks, but don't worry, there are some more approachable examples later.
</p>

Programs can trigger up to 16 *output events*, specified by the `o` attribute, which
ultimately describe the articulation's behavior.

Output events can be used to send a MIDI event to the virtual instrument to cause the
underlying patch to change articulations, or even just to set up routing to some
destination MIDI channel.  Or both: you can have a program send a MIDI event to a
specific channel, and subsequently performed MIDI will be routed to that channel.

Multiple output events are separated by a `/` (forward slash) where each individual
output event roughly takes the form `type@channel:arg1,arg2` (no whitespace allowed).

A more formal specification for a single output event would look like this:

```
[-][type][@channel[.bus]][:arg1[,arg2]][%filter_program]
```

Where elements enclosed in square brackets are optional, and where:


* Output events prefixed with `-` don't affect the routing of future MIDI events.  Otherwise, if channels
  are not prefixed this way then any future user-generated MIDI event will be routed to this channel when
  the articulation is activated.

* `type` defines the type of output event (see below), e.g. note, cc, etc.

* `@channel` specifies the destination MIDI channel of the output event and, unless `type` is
  prefixed with `-`, it implies subsequent MIDI events will also be routed to that destination
  channel.

  When channel is not specified, the destination channel will be dictated by the
  destination channel the defined by the user when the bank was configured on the track.  (See the
  [usage page](../usage#track-setup) for more information on source and destination channels.)

  Alternatively, a special channel value of `-` will direct the output event to
  the destination(s) setup by the previously activated articulation.

* `.bus` specifies the destination bus of the output event and subsequent incoming
   events when the articulation is activated.  `bus` is a value between 1 and 16.

  As with the channel, if not specified the default bus will be dictated by the
  destination bus for the bank's track configuration. If the bus is defined but
  not the channel (e.g. `@.4`) then then the default channel will be used but
  the bus will be overridden.

  If you use Reaticulate's MIDI controller feedback feature, you won't be able to assign
  bus 16 as this bus is used by the feedback feature internally.

* `arg1` and `arg2` depend on the type

* `%filter_program` if defined will only emit the output event if the specified program number
  `filter_program` is currently active on the same channel in another group.  This allows
  the state of other groups to modify the output events emitted by the articulation.

  For example, you might have an articulation group that specifies normal attack
  vs hard attack with different programs.  A single sustain articulation could
  then emit different keyswitches depending on whether the normal or hard attack
  is selected in the group.

Possible output event types are:

| Type      | Definition
|:---------:|---------------
| program   | Program change message.  `arg1` indicates the program number and `arg2` can be omitted.
| cc        | A CC event, with `arg1` indicating the CC number and `arg2` defining the CC value
| note      | A sequence of note-on and note-off events, where `arg1` defines the note number and `arg2` indicates note-on velocity.  `arg2` is optional and if not specified the default velocity is 127.  (It's not possible to specify the note-off velocity, however.  This is a seldom used feature of MIDI.)
| note-hold | A note-on event, where `arg1` and `arg2` are according to the `note` type.  The corresponding note-off event is deferred until the next articulation is activated.  This is useful with patches that use non-latching keyswitches.
| pitch     | A pitch bend event, where `arg1` is the 14-bit pitch bend value between -8192 and 8192 and `arg2` is not used.
| art       | Activate another articulation in the same bank, with `arg1` being the articulation program number and `arg2` is omitted.  This can be used to create composite articulations.  For example if you have articulation groups for con sordino/senza sordino and legato/non-legato, you could have another composite articulation for non-legato sustain con sordino that references the articulations in the other groups.

Be aware that if multiple `note` output events are specified for a given articulation, all note-on
events will be sent before any note-off event.  This means as far as the target patch is concerned
the notes will be simultaneously pressed.  This is also true for `note-hold` events, except that
of course in that case all the necessary note-off events will be deferred until the next articulation.

The `type` can also be empty, specifying just `@channel`, in which case the action of the
articulation will just be to set up routing to the destination channel specified, with no MIDI event
emitted.

Alternatively, if the type is prefixed with a `-` sign (e.g. `-note`) then the output event is
emitted but routing of subsequent user MIDI events to the output event's destination channel
will not be done.  This can be useful for example to send control events to listeners on other
channels.  If _all_ the output events for the articulation are prefixed this way, then the
destination channel routing setup by the previous articulation won't be altered.




## Output Event Examples

Ok, with the technicals out of the way, here are some examples.


### Multiple notes

This one from Cinematic Studio Strings sends 3 separate notes at specific velocities to set sordino
and legato in addition to the sustains patch.

```go
//! g="Reaticulate Examples" n="Multiple Note Outputs"
Bank 42 1 Multiple Note Outputs
//! c=long-light i=con-sord o=note:12/note:22,1/note:23,127
7 con sordino
```

### Simple channel routing

A generic example where we have 3 individual articulation patches on 3 separate MIDI channels and we
want to do simple routing only: no keyswitches needed by the underlying virtual instrument.

```go
//! g="Reaticulate Examples" n="Simple Channel Routing"
Bank 42 2 Simple Channel Routing
//! c=legato i=legato o=@1
20 legato
//! c=long i=note-whole o=@2
1 sustains
//! c=short i=staccato o=@3
40 staccato
```

### One-off layering

Here's another one from Cinematic Studio Strings, setting up spiccato without sordino. The twist is
the "beefy spiccato" program, where we are setting CSS as with spiccato but also layering it with
another patch on channel 2.

```go
//! g="Reaticulate Examples" n="Layering"
Bank 42 3 Articulation Layering
//! c=short i=spiccato o=note:17,1/note:23,1
42 spiccato
//! c=short-dark i=spiccato o=note:17,1/note:23,1/@2
44 beefy spiccato
```

### Both non-latching and latching articulation keyswitches

Now for a more sophisticated example: an excerpt from the Bohemian violin bank.  This instrument
controls legato by a single note toggle keyswitch (hitting the same note repeatedly toggles legato),
so this is in its own group.

Most of the articulations in the Bohemian are only active while the note is held, and once the note
is released, it defaults back to an intelligent, adaptive mode which VirHamonic calls the Performer.
So the trick here is to specify an `off` program for the bank (we arbitrarily choose 0) which
describes the default mode of the Bohemian when no articulations are explicitly chosen.

Finally, the last 3 programs define the Performer styles, and unlike the others, these ones are
latching keyswitches, so we use the `note` type for these.

```go
//! g="Reaticulate Examples" n="Bohemian Violin Exp1" off=0
Bank 42 4 Bohemian Violin Exp1
//! c=long-dark i=note-whole g=2 f=toggle o=note:35
35 chords

//! spacer=1
//! c=long-light i=phrase
0 performer
//! c=long i=note-half o=note-hold:24
24 arc
//! c=long-light i=legato-bowed2 o=note-hold:41
41 rebow

//! spacer=1
//! c=fx i=phrase g=3 o=note:48
48 improv
//! c=fx i=phrase g=3 o=note:49
49 czardas
//! c=fx i=phrase g=3 o=note:50
50 emotive
```

This example also uses the `spacer` attribute to provide a visual separation between the groups.

### Contextual articulations based on state of other groups

Suppose a trumpet library offered a number of different articulations with different types of mutes
(no mute, straight mute, or harmon mute), with each variant being available under a different
patch.

The obvious approach would be to create different articulations for each of the normal vs hard
attack variants.  This is a perfectly cromulent strategy to be sure, but by using filter programs
you could move the hard/normal attack flag to a group and use only a single program for each
articulation even if it offers all three variants.

Here we we have the three different patches for the different mute types on different MIDI
channels.  A single articulation definition can route to the appropriate patch depending on
which mute articulation is selected.

```go
//! g="Reaticulate Examples" n="Contextual Articulations"
Bank 42 5 Contextual Articulations
//! c=long i=note-whole g=2
120 unmuted
//! c=long-light i=stopped g=2
121 straight mute
//! c=long-light i=stopped g=2
122 harmon mute

//! c=long i=note-whole o=note@1:24%120/note@2:24%121/note@3:24%122
1 long
//! c=short i=staccato o=note@1:27%120/note@2:27%121/note@3:27%122
40 staccato
//! c=short i=marcato-quarter o=note@1:28%120/note@2:28%121/note@3:28%122
52 marcato
```

This bank uses programs 120-122 to define the different mute types.  Notice there aren't any
output events with these articulations -- they don't actually emit any outputs directly, but
rather they influence the output events emitted by the long and staccato articulations.

Changing one of the mute types will retrigger long or staccato (whichever is selected) and
cause the appropriate output event to be emitted for the new mute type.


## Articulation Colors

![floating](../img/artcolors.png)

The `c` program attribute defines the color of the button for the articulation, which is either
a [HTML color code](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) or one of the predefined names.  When `c` isn't
specified, then the default color is used.

The image right shows the available names and their out-of-the-box colors.

(The icons shown are just for demonstration purposes.  The color selection has no bearing on the
icon.  That's defined by the `i` attribute.)

The factory banks use the *light* variants for articulations played more softly or subdued than
normale, for example con sordino, sul tasto, or harmonics.  The *dark* variants are used for
grittier, distorted, or louder articulations, such as sul ponticello or Bartok pizzicato.

While you *can* define explicit custom color values, it's recommended you use the named
colors (e.g. `short-dark`) in your banks, because users are able to customize these colors
in Reaticulate's settings page.  If you use an explicit color, then this color is forced
upon other users of your bank.  That may be ok in certain situations, and it's certainly not an
issue if you're the only consumer of the banks you create, but it's something to consider
when sharing your banks with other users.
